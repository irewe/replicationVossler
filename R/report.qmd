## Report no. of alternatives, attributes, levels, block

-   2 alternatives for each choice set

-   4 attributes (spatial scale, BCG change scenario, Location, annual tax increase)

-   Levels per attribute: (3, 4, 2, 10)

-   Five blocks

## Total number of possible choice set

(3\*4\*2\*10)\^2 = 57 600

## Blocks

They had 10 blocks (in two different groups). In one group of blocks they kept spatial unit (combination of spatial scale and location) constant, in the other group they kept the change in environmental status constant. Each respondent got assigned to 2 blocks, either in spatial or the environmental category.

## Explanations of blocks and referendums

### BlockType

1 = "Spatial unit block", Fixed spatial unit, varying BCG(WQ) change scenarios (6-8 proposals per respondent)

2 = "BCG Change block" Fixed BCG(WQ) change scenarios, varying spatial units (8-10 proposals per respondent)

### Spatial_Unit (combination of attributes "Spatial scale" and "Location":

1 = Local, HUC4 (Single watershed)\
2 = Local, Medium (Three watersheds)\
3 = Full area (Full study region)\
4 = Non-local, HUC4 (Single watershed)\
5 = Non-local, Medium (Three watersheds)

### BCG change:

-   1up

-   Scenario 1

-   Scenario 2

-   Scenario 3

### Referendum:
